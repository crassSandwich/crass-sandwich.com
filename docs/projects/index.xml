      <description>Inspired by 80s hacker culture and the combat of Monster Hunter, GriTTY (working title) is a real time, top down action game controlled exclusively through terminal commands.

The combat interface is also thoroughly configurable&amp;mdash;users may define a limited amount of aliases, which allow combos to be entered in a single command, not unlike Unix shell aliases.</description>

A score attack FPS about defending the Pentagon from power-hungry viruses In a cyberpunk 1980s, you are a new recruit to the NSA’s Advanced Infiltration Management System (AIMS) program, which develops and operates a manual firewall. The Pentagon owns a valuable plot of cyber-space; the network situated there is constantly under siege from malicious (probably communist) actors.</description>
