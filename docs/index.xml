      <description>Inspired by 80s hacker culture and the combat of Monster Hunter, GriTTY (working title) is a real time, top down action game controlled exclusively through terminal commands. Combat is deliberate and tense, and because every action has to be keyed out and entered in, there is no time for excess. The combat interface is also thoroughly configurable&amp;mdash;users may define a limited amount of aliases, which allow combos to be entered in a single command, not unlike Unix shell aliases.</description>

      <description>I like video games so I try to make them. Game jams are my jam. Right now I&amp;rsquo;m a student at the University of Rochester, where I study Computer Science and Music. I&amp;rsquo;m also part of a team developing a Hololens application to train doctors, and a TA for the CS department&amp;rsquo;s core AI course. In my free time I descend into the pits of Musical Theater, where I play bass, and I like to write experimental music and post it to my SoundCloud.</description>

      <description>My entry for Ludum Dare 39. Made in 48 hours using Unity, Blender, Cubase, and bfxr.
A score attack FPS about defending the Pentagon from power-hungry viruses In a cyberpunk 1980s, you are a new recruit to the NSA’s Advanced Infiltration Management System (AIMS) program, which develops and operates a manual firewall. The Pentagon owns a valuable plot of cyber-space; the network situated there is constantly under siege from malicious (probably communist) actors.</description>
