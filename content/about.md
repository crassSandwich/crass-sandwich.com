I like video games so I [try to make them](https://crass-sandwich.itch.io). Game jams are my jam. I'm currently in school, studying Computer Science and Music, and helping other students learn the proper mixture of reagents required to concoct Neural Networks and other such digital golems. In my free time I descend into the pits of Musical Theater, where I play bass, and I like to write experimental music and post it to my [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/crass_sandwich).
