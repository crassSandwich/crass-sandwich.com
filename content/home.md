I like video games so I [try to make them](https://crass-sandwich.itch.io). Game jams are my jam. Right now I'm a student at the University of Rochester, where I study Computer Science and Music. I'm also developing a Hololens application to train doctors on drug-to-drug interactions in the treatment of HIV, and TA-ing for the CS department's core AI course. In my free time I play bass for a variety of ensembles, inclusing UR Symphony Orchestra and ROC Players' upcoming production of *Spring Awakening*.
