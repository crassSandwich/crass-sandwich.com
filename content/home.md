I like video games so I [try to make them](https://crass-sandwich.itch.io). Game jams are my jam. Right now I'm a student at the University of Rochester, where I study Computer Science and Music. I'm also part of a team developing a Hololens application to train doctors, and a TA for the CS department's core AI course. In my free time I descend into the pits of Musical Theater, where I play bass, and I like to write experimental music and post it to my [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/crass_sandwich).
