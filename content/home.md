I like video games so I [try to make them](https://crass-sandwich.itch.io). Game jams are my jam. I'm currently in school, studying Computer Science and Music, and TAing a course on Artificial Intelligence. In my free time I descend into the pits of Musical Theater, where I play bass, and I like to write experimental music and post it to my [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/crass_sandwich).
