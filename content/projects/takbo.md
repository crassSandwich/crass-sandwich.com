And then, read my thoughts on the process below.

# Everything is Monster Hunter

Monster Hunter is one of my favorite game franchises of all time for its brilliantly-paced combat and highly compelling game loop. While I don't think I'll have the chance to work on any kind of 3D Monster-Hunter-like for a long time, I can at least ape some of the smartest things it does in small doses.

One of those things is the weapon combo system. Most 3D action games give you a light attack and a heavy attack. You can mash the light attack a few times, or throw a heavy attack in there once, however you want to handle it. In Monster Hunter, the variance is much bigger; very often, the attacks you can do change entirely based on your previous attack. Weapon combos become a dense, looping tree, and the act of learning combos becomes just as much about mapping their geography as it is about understanding when to use which moves.

restricted system with room for creative expression

there's a reason why walking simulators were so contentious during the brief period when they were inescapable: they offer too much freedom. anything you want to do, you can do it with minimal friction. that's cool the first time you do it, but mundane the 10th time. mundane gameplay is a killer; you have to work so much harder in every other area to achieve any semblance of escapism.
